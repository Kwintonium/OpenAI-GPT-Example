# Creating a YouTube Video Idea Helper Leveraging OpenAI GPT (LLMs)


ChatGPT has made a renowned impact on the world - one we as a society cannot come back from. As LLMs will inevitably become more popular and enhance or take away jobs, I decided to do some research into the basic implmentation of one uniquely purposed to a particular function to understand its usability as a data scientist.

In this case, the unique purpose of this project is to leverage OpenAI and streamlit in Python to quickly deploy a web page that is easily interactable by users of varying technical capabilities to generate YouTube prompts to follow. The output of the model is a Video Title and a Video Script, alongside supporting Wikipedia information.

Of course, LLMs are great for other things too, such as processing structured data, reviewing code, or sifting through documentation. Speaking of which, here's the API documentation: https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html!
